Why are you interested in robotics?

1. Cybernetic technology

Dr. Kevin Warrick changed the world by being the world's first cyborg. His research in embodied systems is very fascinating. My knowledge in biology coupled with my experience in robotics and control system design will allow me contribute to this area  and develop more complexed hybird systems. 

2. Complex control systems

Studying mechatronics engineering as an undergrad gave me a glimpse into the importance of designing stable control system. Enhancing my knowledge in complex control systems design will give me the tools necessary to mathematically model the human nervous system and develop a control algorithm to facilitate organic learning in hybird systems using reinforcement learning techniques. 

3. Artificial intelligence 

My time as a student in Udacity's Robotics Software Engineering Nanodegree (RoboND) program has drastically increased my knowledfe in artificial intelligence. This is an ever changing field, therefore my goal is to always take advantage of opportunities to stay current with the technology. This idea is apart of the "life long student" mantra; learn more and more everyday, and contribute in the future. I'd like to one day revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. 

4. Prosthetics device 

People lose their limbs as a result of tragic accidents or unfortunate diseases and sometimes feel less than human. I believe that people deserve the opportunity to restore their humanity with prosthetic devices that provides that closesly mirrors the  of a human limb. As a Nanotechnology and Biomedicine Research Scholar, I explored the feasibilty of polymer surfaces for osteochondral tissue regeneration. Incoporating this technology into artificial limb could lead to a revolutionary break through in prosthetic devices.  

What are your career goals?

1. Serve as CTO for new tech start ups 
2. MD/PhD 
3. Develop the next generation of prosthetics 
4. CEO of a Flying Vehicle company


What skills or abilities do you hope to strengthen in the program?

1. Embedded system programming

I took embedded systems as an elective as an undergrad student at Kennesaw State University (KSU). Throughout the course I was constantly reminded at how closely computer architectiure resembles the nervous system. In this program I hope to gain a deeper understanding of embedded systems programming so that I can model the mammalian nervous. Fundamentals of Mechatronics, a class at KSU, and Udacity's RoboND program provided me with a decent amount of knowledge in Microcontroller programming my overall goal is to expand on this topic from a graduate school prespective. 

2. Optimal control system design

Motion planning and autonomous navigation is necessary for a world in which flying cars exist. I'd like to my advance my tools by applying optimal control principles to autonomous flying vehicles.
